## The Project

Basically what I wanted to do here is to have 3 words which will be provided by the user and then display them on another component. But user is not allowed to display messages if 3 words is not provided. Error message is promoted if user tries to display words without providing 3 of them. Live version is here: https://interactive-words.netlify.app/
